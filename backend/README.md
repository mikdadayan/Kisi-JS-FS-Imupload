## Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Applied rate limiting in the endpoint levels to prevent abuse of the API.
- **Validation**: Ensures that only valid data is processed.
- **Secure Headers**: Implemented using Helmet to set various HTTP headers.

## Dependencies

- `cors`: Enable CORS with various options.
- `express-rate-limit`: Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express.
- `express`: Express middleware for validating requests.
- `helmet`: Secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling multi-part/form-data, primarily used for file uploads in Node.js.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, typically used for configuration settings in Node.js applications, not related to SQLite.

## Development Dependencies

- `nodemon`: Automatically restart the application when file changes are detected.
